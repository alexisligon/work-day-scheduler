# Work Day Scheduler Week 5

## The Task

This week I had to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. I hard coded a table to display normal work day hours. There was a row for each hour, 9-5. Each hour had a section for the user to input a to-do and a save button. The save button allowed the user to save the work to be done to local storage, so when the page refreshed, the task was stil displayed. The current time was updated at the top of the screen, and as the day went on, each hour row changed color to indicate whether that time block was in the past, present, or future.
